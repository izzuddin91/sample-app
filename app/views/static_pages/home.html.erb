          <h4>Do you stayed up till the middle of the night just to learn how to code?</h4>
          <p>Yup, I do. In fact, I did stay up till next morning just to learn the basics of objective-c. I quit my previous job and came to programming as I soon began to realize how addicted I am to coding.You don't have to be genius to learn how to code.Do you need to be genius just to learn to read and write?</p>
          <p>This website is dedicated to anyone who is learning programming, either seasoned programmer or beginners.Either front end-er and back end-er.We don't care which background you come from; C, C++, Java, Phyton, Ruby, HTML, CSS, or just to do networking with various kind of programmers. We'll try to create events to gather programmers, sharing their knowledge on different kind of language while serving you guys a cup of coffee to keep you awake. Hop on to the geek world!!</p>
